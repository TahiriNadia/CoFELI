Multiplication (often denoted by the cross symbol ×, by the mid-line dot operator ⋅, by juxtaposition, or, on computers, by an asterisk *) is one of the four elementary mathematical operations of arithmetic, with the other ones being addition, subtraction, and division. The result of a multiplication operation is called a product.

The division sign (÷) is a symbol consisting of a short horizontal line with a dot above and another dot below, used in Anglophone countries to indicate mathematical division. However, this usage, though widespread in some countries, is not universal; it is used for other purposes in other countries and its use to denote division is not recommended in the ISO 80000-2 standard for mathematical notation.

The slash is an oblique slanting line punctuation mark /. Once used to mark periods and commas, the slash is now used to represent exclusive or inclusive or, division and fractions, and as a date separator. It is called a solidus in Unicode, is also known as an oblique stroke, and has several other historical or technical names including oblique and virgule.
This character is distinct from U+2044 FRACTION SLASH. It is intended to represent the operation of dividing, not an actual fraction. For a discussion see this detailed answer on SuperUser.
